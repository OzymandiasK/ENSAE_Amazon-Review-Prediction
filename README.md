# ENSAE_PythonMachineLearning
This repo is for a Machine Learning project in Python at ENSAE ParisTech, for Xavier Dupre's class. 
Our goal was to predict a product's review rating (1 to 5) using the review text.
We implemented classic "Bag of Words" text mining techniques to extract features, and used Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers.
